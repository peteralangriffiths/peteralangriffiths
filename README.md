- 👋 Hi, I’m Peter Alan Griffiths, a South African whose primary work experience has been in the teaching and technical writing fields.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing a server-based web application called Broad Canvass Server that captures voter data sent to it from multiple Broad Canvass Client web applications hosted on workstations, tablets and smart phones that previously captured this voter data from printed voter canvassing sheets. Each Broad Canvass Server instance will use a SQL database to store data at a municipal level, which is subdivided into ward level, which is, in its turn, sudbdivided into residence type level (with corresponding residence type identifiers) for one or more voters at a specific residential address. Broad Canvass Client users will be able to delimit the voter residential address data they are currently capturing at ward level and residence type level by requesting applicable data dumps from their parent Broad Canvass Server instance. This means they should almost always be able to capture voter residential address data primarily by entering residence type identifier search strings in a search control and selecting the correct voter residential address from the drop down control that appears. Broad Canvass Client users will also need to populate National ID Number, First Name/s, Surname, Mobile Number and Email Address record fields for each voter. I intend that voter data captured at Broad Canvass Client level will be uploaded to the SQL database that runs on the applicable Broad Canvass Server instance whenever all available data for a specific residence type within a specific ward has been captured or a voter data capturing session has drawn to a close. Each Broad Canvass Server instance will likely have reporting features in future releases and may also be integrated with voter data SQL databases that run at a provincial and even national level.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how to develop Broad Canvass Server using React and a SQL database and about how to develop Broad Canvass Client using React Native and (in all probability) a NoSQL database.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with someone who has existing skills in exchanging data between React-based server and React Native-based client instances as described above, or who would be interested in developing those skills together with me.
